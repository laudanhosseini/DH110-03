## Introductory Steps

## Step 1: Identify Main Design Challenges
### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
The goal of this activity is to create a better-designed and more accessible application for mobile reaading. A lot of apps are not user friendly in general, but in terms of usability for senior citizens, the issues are exacerbated. Whether it is to study, teach, write their own stories, or relax, reading is a common activity among this group of people. Thus, if the concept of reading was transitioned onto a digital platform, the act of reading can surely be  made more efficient platform in order to enhance the experience of reading as a whole. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The activity of reading-- namely on a user-friendly digital platform-- can fulfill users' sense of enjoyment and contentment for their favorite hobbies, further users' personal development, or strengthen users' academic needs. Again, a lot of the older generation enjoy reading as a way to escape and relax, so creating an application tailored to this idea could help enhance those positive emotions even more. If reading is needed for academic purposes, the sense of productivity and efficiency can be enhanced in the user as well. 
### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions are reading physical/tangible text, finding and downloading the desired text on a web browser, using an application that allows one to annotate and/or highlight text, or using an application that has the text be read to you (ex. Audible or Audiobooks HQ). However, a lot of these apps are very costly or have a lot of usability issues, such as with visibility of system status, aesthetic and design, or match between system and the real world.  

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Some limitations with physical reading could be that there would be a pile up and clutter of so many books (decreases accessibility), a waste of paper, or the inability to read text in the dark. Some limitations with digital reading could be the costly monthly subscriptions, the screen not being visible under direct sunlight, lack of downloading efficiency or signals of uploading progress, and poor organizations for readings. With technology, the issues with physical reading can surely go away, and by creating more detailed and structural components to existing applications (such as Audiobooks HQ), issues with digital reading itself can also be improved significantly. Some improvements included adding a feature that changes the brightness automatically based on sunlight exposure, adding downloading percentage signals, or adding organizational tabs that filter out different types of readings. With this, the demand for online reading can increase. 

## Step 2: Identify Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographics: senior citizens, middle to upper class, primarily English speaking, more likely to have had higher education

Preferences: enjoy reading as a leisurely activity/personal development and/or as a tool for teaching or studying

Expertise: does not require any level of expertise (other than basic reading skills)

### Where would the users do that activity?
Users can choose any location that gives them maximum focus to read the material. For leisure reading, users can find a quiet, peaceful location, such as in their bedroom or somewhere outside. For studying/teaching purposes, users can find a quiet classroom, office, or comfortable coffee shop to do the reading. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity?
Users can either read using tangible sources (actual books, printed articles, etc.), use an annotating application, or use an application that reads the text to you. For this activity, the user would a computer and web browser of their choosing to access the digital reading application. 

## Step 3: Pick Observation Method(s)
The two observation methods I used were participatory observation and interview. 

I had the participant recorded on a computer with a working camera and microphone, and I used the Zoom app to record the session. Similar to the usability test, I wanted to record the facial features of the participant to better understand initial reactions and any confusion or enjoyment. Additionally, I needed a mobile phone to access the app, Audiobooks HQ, so that I could screen record the users' actions as she explored the various features of this digital reading platform. 

**Bold Text** Participatory Observation: 
I wanted to see the natural navigation of the user with a particular digital reading app that has usability issues. This is so I could see the participant's natural searches and track any reactions to the tasks at hand. While this is very similar to the usability test from the previous week, I found it incredibly important to be done again so that I can more freely of what types of books the reader gravitates towards. 

**Bold Text** Interview: 
I served as the moderator who guided the participant through a series of tasks that involved using the app Audiobooks HQ. The questions I asked varied from the usability test, as it was no longer so focused on the application, but rather the user herself. I wanted to see what she wanted to search for, the purpose of her using a digital reading app, and her general wants/needs/goals from digital reading. I began by (1) asking basic background questions on her reading habits then (2) transitioned into the use of the app then (3) reflected on any issues she ran into using the app and with digital reading in general.
