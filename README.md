## Introductory Steps

## Step 1: Identify Main Design Challenges
### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
The goal of this activity is to create a better-designed and more accessible application for mobile reaading. A lot of apps are not user friendly in general, but in terms of usability for senior citizens, the issues are exacerbated. Whether it is to study, teach, write their own stories, or relax, reading is a common activity among this group of people. Thus, if the concept of reading was transitioned onto a digital platform, the act of reading can surely be  made more efficient platform in order to enhance the experience of reading as a whole. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The activity of reading-- namely on a user-friendly digital platform-- can fulfill users' sense of enjoyment and contentment for their favorite hobbies, further users' personal development, or strengthen users' academic needs. Again, a lot of the older generation enjoy reading as a way to escape and relax, so creating an application tailored to this idea could help enhance those positive emotions even more. If reading is needed for academic purposes, the sense of productivity and efficiency can be enhanced in the user as well. 
### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions are reading physical/tangible text, finding and downloading the desired text on a web browser, using an application that allows one to annotate and/or highlight text, or using an application that has the text be read to you (ex. Audible or Audiobooks HQ). However, a lot of these apps are very costly or have a lot of usability issues, such as with visibility of system status, aesthetic and design, or match between system and the real world.  

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Some limitations with physical reading could be that there would be a pile up and clutter of so many books (decreases accessibility), a waste of paper, or the inability to read text in the dark. Some limitations with digital reading could be the costly monthly subscriptions, the screen not being visible under direct sunlight, lack of downloading efficiency or signals of uploading progress, and poor organizations for readings. With technology, the issues with physical reading can surely go away, and by creating more detailed and structural components to existing applications (such as Audiobooks HQ), issues with digital reading itself can also be improved significantly. Some improvements included adding a feature that changes the brightness automatically based on sunlight exposure, adding downloading percentage signals, or adding organizational tabs that filter out different types of readings. With this, the demand for online reading can increase. 

## Step 2: Identify Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographics: senior citizens, middle to upper class, primarily English speaking, more likely to have had higher education

Preferences: enjoy reading as a leisurely activity/personal development and/or as a tool for teaching or studying

Expertise: does not require any level of expertise (other than basic reading skills)

### Where would the users do that activity?
Users can choose any location that gives them maximum focus to read the material. For leisure reading, users can find a quiet, peaceful location, such as in their bedroom or somewhere outside. For studying/teaching purposes, users can find a quiet classroom, office, or comfortable coffee shop to do the reading. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity?
Users can either read using tangible sources (actual books, printed articles, etc.), use an annotating application, or use an application that reads the text to you. For this activity, the user would a computer and web browser of their choosing to access the digital reading application. 

## Step 3: Pick Observation Method(s)
The two observation methods I used were participatory observation and interview. 

I had the participant recorded on a computer with a working camera and microphone, and I used the Zoom app to record the session. Similar to the usability test, I wanted to record the facial features of the participant to better understand initial reactions and any confusion or enjoyment. Additionally, I needed a mobile phone to access the app, Audiobooks HQ, so that I could screen record the users' actions as she explored the various features of this digital reading platform. 

**Participatory Observation:** 
I wanted to see the natural navigation of the user with a particular digital reading app that has usability issues. This is so I could see the participant's natural searches and track any reactions to the tasks at hand. While this is very similar to the usability test from the previous week, I found it incredibly important to be done again so that I can more freely of what types of books the reader gravitates towards. 

**Interview:** 
I served as the moderator who guided the participant through a series of tasks that involved using the app Audiobooks HQ. The questions I asked varied from the usability test, as it was no longer so focused on the application, but rather the user herself. I wanted to see what she wanted to search for, the purpose of her using a digital reading app, and her general wants/needs/goals from digital reading. I began by (1) asking basic background questions on her reading habits then (2) transitioned into the use of the app then (3) reflected on any issues she ran into using the app and with digital reading in general.

### User Insights

**User discussing main purpose for online reading**

"So I'm in you know, a lot of the medical classes, some classes that require, you know, a lot of really thick textbooks, a lot of information, and a lot of reading a lot of articles. And I'm also in research labs and volunteer at the hospitals, you know, it's a lot of material. And I've kind of gotten used to everything being online for the most part when it comes to that."

**User discussing a feature she would like on the Audiobooks HQ app**

"So maybe we just have a smaller button at the top that you can click, and it's like a drop down menu with all those other smaller pieces. I think trying to have everything laid out on one page is a lot."

**User discussing her ideal digital reading app**

"But it would be easier if everything was in one place and kind of more concise, okay. Also, a lot of things are affordable. Like, if I just need like one article, that's really short, just like one little piece of like evidence or something, I'll have to like, ask me to pay like $20 $50 just to see and like, get access to it. Okay. I think if there was like a service that had all of those in one that you can just pay for, like, a monthly membership is something you could access, like 1000s of databases, that would be great."

"I think I mean, I maybe I would try to create a version that's more for students, and they have, you know, lots of data sources and scholarly articles and peer reviewed articles that allow you to kind of filter by information and like what topics and different you know, individual things we're trying to learn about. And then from there, even being able to filter through different sections of the audio books that you don't have to, you know, listen to a wide range of a long chunk of them to find the information you're looking for."

## Reflection

I think that overall, this interview session went pretty smoothly. There were no technical errors, and it seemed that the participant had no confusions in following along with the script. The main thing I would change for the future, however, is the actual participant I chose. Due to a lack of accessibility, the only person I could use as a participant was one of my roommates. She is a young college student, so this does not fit the criteria quite well in terms of creating a user-friendly application for senior citizens. I think the data would be more valuable if I was able to interview someone who fit into that age group. Although, the younger generation is surely more adept at using technology, so seeing the issues my participant ran into was still valuable because that means that those issues would be even greater for older generations who struggle more with navigating technological applications. A lot of what was discussed made sense in my mind about the issues I highlighted inthe introduction. Overall, I learned a lot more about the purposes for digital reading, certain issues associated with it, and ways to create a more idealized version of existing apps.
