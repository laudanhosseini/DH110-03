## Introductory Steps

## Step 1: Identify Main Design Challenges
### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
The goal of this activity is to create a better-designed and more accessible application for mobile reaading. A lot of apps are not user friendly in general, but in terms of usability for senior citizens, the issues are exacerbated. Reading is a common activity among this group of people, so transitioning this onto a mobile platform will help with efficiency and enhance the experience of reading as a whole. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity would fulfill users' sense of enjoyment and contentment for their favorite hobbies. Again, a lot of the older generation enjoy reading as a way to escape and relax, so creating an application related to this could help enhance those positive emotions even more. 
### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions are applications that allow one to annotate and/or highlight text as well as have the text be read to you (ex. Audible or Audiobooks HQ). However, a lot of these apps are very costly or have a lot of usability issues, such as with visibility of system status or aesthetic and design.  

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Some limitations could be the costly monthly subscriptions, the screen not being visible under direct sunlight, lack of downloading efficiency or signals of uploading progress, and poor organizations for readings. Creating more detailed and structural components to these applications, such as Audiobooks HQ, can increase the demand for online reading and help users with this experience. 

## Step 2: Identify Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographics: senior citizens, middle to upper class, primarily English speaking, more likely to have had higher education

Preferences: enjoy reading as a leisurely activity/personal development and/or as a tool for teaching or studying

Expertise: does not require any level of expertise (other than basic reading skills)

### Where would the users do that activity?
Users can choose any location that gives them maximum focus to read the material. For leisure reading, users can find a quiet, peaceful location, such as in their bedroom or somewhere outside. For studying/teaching purposes, users can find a quiet classroom, office, or comfortable coffee shop to do the reading. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity?
Users can either read using tangible sources (actual books, printed articles, etc.), use an annotating application, or use an application that reads the text to you. 

## Step 3: Pick Observation Method(s)
The two observation methods I used were participatory observation and interview. 

Participatory Observation: 
I wanted to see the natural way that the participant likes to read in, so I had the participant go to a quiet space that is typically used for this activity. I then observed how the reader set up and completed the experience of reading.

Interview: 
I served as the moderator who guided the participant through a series of tasks that involved using the app Audiobooks HQ. While this is very similar to the usability test, it is incredibly important to be done again so that I can more freely of what types of books the reader gravitates towards as well as her natural navigation throughout the app.
